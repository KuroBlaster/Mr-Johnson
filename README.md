Why do we need to set up tasks/duties and responsibilities on our own and then manage our time by ourselves. Why can’t everyone have a “secretary” which does everything a secretary does. Why can’t everyone have Morgan Freeman as their secretary(Zuckerberg Reference).

What if there was an app which has voice communication and voice recognition abilities, but it also manages your time based on your preferences and is able to adapt. 
So for example, after using this app for 2 weeks, the Mr. Johnson has figured out the most productive time for you is 8:30 in the evening. Now based on how hard the task you have told the Mr. Johnson,how urgent the task is and how fearful you feel about it, the task would be assigned in such a way that you would be willing to do that task at the specific time.
